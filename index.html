      <h2>What is Front-End Development</h2>
      <p>
        Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive
        elements of a website that users interact with directly. It's a
        combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where HTML provides the
        structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic
        behaviour and interactivity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Tools used for front-end development</h2>
      <p>
        There are several tools and platforms, such as
        <strong>WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal,</strong>
        available that can be used to develop the front end of a website.
      </p>
      <h2>What Does a Front-End Developer Do?</h2>
      <p>
        A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web
        languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access
        and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design
        elements you see were created by a front-end developer.
      </p>
      <h2>Front-end developer job description</h2>
      <p>
        If someone wanted to build a website, they might hire a front-end
        developer to create the site's layout. The front-end developer
        determines where to place images, what the navigation should look like,
        and how to present the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the
        appearance and layout of the site or application is easy to navigate and
        intuitive for the user.
